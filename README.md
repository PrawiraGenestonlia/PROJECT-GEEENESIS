* **client-mentors:** A progressive web-app (also known as HTML5 app), built using React, is used by mentors to interact and see the profile of their mentees.
* **client-students:** A progressive web-app (also known as HTML5 app), built using React, is used by mentors to interact and see the profile of their mentees.
* **server-api-endpoint:** We don't make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/).
